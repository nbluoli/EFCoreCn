# SQLite limitations

The SQLite provider has a number of migrations limitations. Most of these limitations are a result of limitations in the underlying SQLite database engine and are not specific to EF.

Note: This documentation is for EF Core. For EF6.x, see [Entity Framework 6](../../../ef6/index.md).

## Modeling limitations

The common relational library (shared by Entity Framework relational database providers) defines APIs for modelling concepts that are common to most relational database engines. A couple of these concepts are not supported by the SQLite provider.

* Schemas
* Sequences

## Migrations limitations

The SQLite database engine does not support a number of schema operations that are supported by the majority of other relational databases. If you attempt to apply one of the unsupported operations to a SQLite database then a `NotSupportedException` will be thrown.

| Operation            | Supported? |
| -------------------- | ---------- |
| AddColumn            | ✔          |
| AddForeignKey        | ✗          |
| AddPrimaryKey        | ✗          |
| AddUniqueConstraint  | ✗          |
| AlterColumn          | ✗          |
| CreateIndex          | ✔          |
| CreateTable          | ✔          |
| DropColumn           | ✗          |
| DropForeignKey       | ✗          |
| DropIndex            | ✔          |
| DropPrimaryKey       | ✗          |
| DropTable            | ✔          |
| DropUniqueConstraint | ✗          |
| RenameColumn         | ✗          |
| RenameIndex          | ✗          |
| RenameTable          | ✔          |

## Migrations limitations workaround

You can workaround some of these limitations by manually writing code in your migrations to perform a table rebuild. A table rebuild involves renaming the existing table, creating a new table, copying data to the new table, and dropping the old table. You will need to use the `Sql(string)` method to perform some of these steps.

See [Making Other Kinds Of Table Schema Changes](http://sqlite.org/lang_altertable.html#otheralter) in the SQLite documentation for more details.

In the future, EF may support some of these operations by using the table rebuild approach under the covers. You can [track this feature on our GitHub project](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework/issues/329).
