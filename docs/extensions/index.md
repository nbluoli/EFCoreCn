# Tools & Extensions

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is for EF Core. For EF6.x, see [Entity Framework 6](../../ef6/index.md).

Tools and extensions provide additional functionality for Entity Framework Core.

Extensions are built by a variety of sources. Not all extensions are maintained as part of the Entity Framework Core project. When considering a third party extension, be sure to evaluate quality, licensing, support, etc. to ensure they meet your requirements.
